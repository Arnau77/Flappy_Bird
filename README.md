# Flappy bird

This project is my first solo project (after my first year at College) and the goal (which I've achieved) was to finish it in four days, the project consists in a reproduction of the game Flappy Bird.

## Installation

1. Download the last zip document in the github release page.
2. Inside the zip search and open the exe, you will be able to play the game now.
3. Enjoy it!

## Usage

This game is played using these keys in the keyboard:

- Spacebar: to jump and to click the clickable buttons in the menus.
 
- Return (or Enter): to pause and unpause the game.

## History

Release history: 

-Flappy Bird, v1.0:
    Final version of the game, you can play and pause the game as in the original one. However, the buttons share and score in the different menus are not available for two reasons: the first one is that I don't have knowledge on how to link a website in my game, the second reason is that I haven't been able to see the interface that appears when you click the score button (all the places where I've played that button was unusable) so I decided to not use that button.
